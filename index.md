These pre-exercises are designed to prepare you for using Docker containers in the context of
the CMS Open Data Workshop. This is *not* a full introduction to Docker, however,
we do take time to explain some key concepts that should make your experience a smooth one.

Note that you could also use virtual machines (VMs) to interface with the CERN Open Data,
but in this workshop, we will only use the Docker container environment.

If you run into problems with any of these steps, please reach out to the organizers
through the dedicated [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsodwswhepp24/channels/pre-exercises-help).
